# SplitLah
SplitLah is a desktop application with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for **splitting bills** amongst you and your friends after a group outing.
Each group outing can consist of several activities with **different people paying the bill** for each activity.
SplitLah does the work of **calculating how much each participant owes** and who they must pay at the end of the outing.


SplitLah also **consolidates all debts intelligently** so that they can be paid off with the fewest number of transactions 
possible, helping you **reduce time spent on making unnecessary transactions**. 
SplitLah remembers your information by saving your outings and activities so that you can **look up past activities** anytime you want.
If you can type fast, SplitLah can manage your outings faster than applications using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Who SplitLah is for:
- People who go on group outings often and need to split bills.
- People who go on group outings where different people pay for different activities, making bill-splitting harder.
- People who dislike manually calculating how much everyone owes across several activities.
- People who want to manage outings with multiple social circles in one application.

## How to use this user guide
- Each feature that SplitLah supports is known as a command.
- These commands are divided into five sections: [Session Management](#session-management), [Activity Management](#activity-management), 
[Transaction Management](#transaction-management), [Group Management](#group-management) and [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous).
- Each command has its own section in this guide explaining them in greater detail.
- The format for each command is enclosed within a `code block`, so that they can be copied directly into SplitLah if needed.
  - Example: `help`
- In each command: 
  - The points indicated under üí° are **important notes** to be mindful of when using the command.
  - The points indicated under ‚ö†Ô∏è are **warnings** that you should pay attention to when using the command.
- The button at the end of each section or subsection provides a hyperlink back to the table of contents that includes it.

## Quick Notes
- Allowed characters for values:
  - Names of `Sessions`,`Activities` and `Groups` can have all printable [ASCII](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html) characters.
  - Names of participants can only contain: `A-Z`, `a-z`
  - Decimals (up to 2 decimal places): `3.5`, `3.95`
  - Unique identifiers must be positive integers less than or equal to `2147483647`: `1`, `3`
  - Dates (DD-MM-YYYY or today): `02-04-2022`, `today`
- A forward slash `/` indicates a delimiter and is used to separate commands into parts.
  Each command's documentation specifies the required delimiters and their purpose.
  - Example: `/n`, `/sid`
  - Therefore, the forward slash `/` should **only** be used to indicate the delimiters,
    and **never** in the arguments.
- Parameters enclosed in `[ ]` must be supplied by the user.
  - Example: `[SESSION_ID]`
- Parameters with an ellipsis `...` indicate that the user can supply multiple values.
  - Example: `[COST1 COST2 ...]`
- Parameters enclosed within `[<` and `>]` indicates that the arguments are optional.
  - Example: `[</gst [GST_PERCENTAGE]>] [</sc [SERVICE_CHARGE]>]`
- Parameters enclosed within `{` and `}` indicates that at least one of the delimiters
  and their respective arguments have to be supplied.
  - Example: `{/pl [NAME1 NAME2 ...] /gid [GROUD_ID]}`

## Warnings
- If the save file cannot be created, **nothing will be saved** during the runtime of SplitLah.
- The save file is **not meant to be read or edited**.
  - If the save file is edited, the application will not be able to load the corrupted save file.
  - A corrupted save file will then be replaced with a new save file upon running SplitLah,
    **all previously saved information will be lost**.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest .jar version of SplitLah from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/releases)
3. Copy the file to the folder you wish to use as a home folder for SplitLah.
4. Open a terminal and set the working directory to the home folder.
5. Start SplitLah by executing `java -jar SplitLah.jar` in the terminal.
6. Type in a command and press Enter to execute it.
7. Refer to [Features](#features) for a more in-depth explanation of all commands available.

## How SplitLah works
* An activity represents a single group activity, paid for by one person. It stores a list of its participants,
  the payer and how much each participant owes.
  * Example: `Lunch at a restaurant`
  * Consisting of the following participants:
    * `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`
  * Paid for by:
    * `Alice`
* A session represents a group outing that that spans a period of time and stores activities,
  as well as a list of participants. Each activity can have a different payer.
  * Example: `Bob's birthday`
  * Consisting of the following participants:
    * `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`
  * Consisting of the following activities:
    * `Breakfast at McDonald's`, `Lunch at a restaurant`, `Movie at a theatre`
    * Each paid for by a different person.
* At the end of a session, SplitLah calculates how much each person owes and who they need to pay. This information is
  displayed in an easy-to-read summary.

### Creating an activity: `activity /create`
Creates an activity with the details that you specify and then assigns it to a session. <br>

There are 2 ways that you can specify the costs of an activity:
1. Record the total cost to be split amongst everyone involved.
2. Record each person's individual cost.

> Format 1: `activity /create /sid [SESSION_ID] /n [ACTIVITY_NAME] /p [PAYER] /i [NAME1 NAME2 ...]
/co [TOTAL_COST] [</gst [GST_PERCENTAGE]>] [</sc [SERVICE_CHARGE]>]`
> 
> Format 2: `activity /create /sid [SESSION_ID] /n [ACTIVITY_NAME] /p [PAYER] /i [NAME1 NAME2 ...]
/cl [COST1 COST2 ...] [</gst [GST_PERCENTAGE]>] [</sc [SERVICE_CHARGE]>]`
>
>* `[SESSION_ID]` refers to the unique identifier of the session.
>    * The unique identifier for a session can be retrieved with the [`session /list`](#listing-all-sessions-session-list) command.
>* `[ACTIVITY_NAME]` refers to the name of the activity.
>    * The activity name is **case-insensitive**.
>* `[PAYER]` refers to the person who paid for the activity.
>    * The person's name is **case-insensitive**.
>* `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` refers to a list of participants in the activity.
>    * Each individual name is **case-insensitive**.
>* `[TOTAL_COST]` refers to the total cost of the activity.
>* `[COST1 COST2 ...]` refers to a list of costs respective to each person involved in the activity.
>    * Example: `/i Alice Bob /cl 10 20` means that _Alice's_ portion cost _$10_ while _Bob's_ portion cost _$20_.
>* `[GST_PERCENTAGE]` refers to the additional percentage GST that may be charged during the activity.
>* `[SERVICE_CHARGE]` refers to the additional percentage service charge that may be charged during the activity.

## _Transaction Management_

### Settling all transactions for a session: `session /summary`

Displays a transaction summary for a session. The transaction summary helps you calculate how much each person in the session
must pay and to whom they should pay for all debts to be resolved.<br>

> Format: `session /summary /sid [SESSION_ID]`
> * `[SESSION_ID]` refers to the unique identifier of the session.

### Creating a group: `group /create`
Creates a new group consisting of a group of individuals. You can use this group whenever you are creating a new session
that involves the same group of individuals. This saves you time when entering the list of participants for the session.

>    * The group name is **case-insensitive**.

## FAQ

**Q**: Is data saved to the disk upon exit?

**A**: SplitLah 2.0 creates a save file in a folder named `data` that is created in the same directory as
`SplitLah.jar`. Changes are saved whenever a `create`, `delete` or `edit` command is run.

**Q**: How do session, activity and group unique identifiers work?

**A**: Unique identifiers uniquely identify each session, activity and group separately. Once a unique identifier
has been allocated, it will not be changed nor reused.

**Q**: Is there any way I can mark a transaction that is shown using the `session /summary` command as paid?

**A**: As of now, this functionality is not supported by SplitLah. All functionalities that SplitLah supports are documented in this user guide.
You can find a summary of all available commands in the [Command Summary](#command-summary) below.
